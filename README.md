# Sustainable Ideas

## Why?
I decided that it is time for machine learning algorithms to start solving tasks that are of more importance than making money and that will empower humanity through this wonderful technology.  The idea behind this repository is to mine state-of-the-art large language models (and their assistant counterparts) for possible paths to a sustainable future.

## Community

Feel free to contribute.  I will start a Discord server if this idea generates enough people who are willing to generate ideas for making humanity brighter using their GPT-4 access.

## Standards

*Include your propmts*, for example

### Prompt to GPT-4
```write a short introduction for a github repository that features papers just like the one you wrote called SustainableIdeas```

# SustainableIdeas: A Hub for Sustainable Energy Innovations

Welcome to SustainableIdeas, an open-source GitHub repository dedicated to sharing and collaborating on cutting-edge research papers and ideas in the realm of sustainable energy. This repository aims to foster innovation by providing a platform where researchers, engineers, students, and hobbyists can contribute and learn from the shared knowledge.

This space is not limited to just conventional renewable energy technologies; it thrives on novel, out-of-the-box ideas. From thermoelectric plate arrays on marine vessels to energy harnessing from unusual sources, SustainableIdeas promotes creative thinking and transformative solutions in the face of our global energy challenge.

Here, you will find a wealth of information, including:

- Full-length papers exploring the newest findings in sustainable energy, like our featured study on thermoelectric plate array-driven electricity generation.
- Discussions and debates on the feasibility, scalability, and impact of the presented concepts.
- Collaborative projects working towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of existing models.

Join us in creating a sustainable future, one idea at a time. Whether you are here to contribute your own work or learn from others, we are glad to have you with us on this journey. We look forward to seeing your sustainable ideas!
