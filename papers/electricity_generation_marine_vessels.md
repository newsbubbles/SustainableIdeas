# Thermoelectric Plate Array-Driven Electricity Generation on Marine Vessels: An Innovative Pathway to Sustainable Energy

## Abstract

This paper presents the design and efficiency analysis of a novel thermoelectric plate array (TPA) system mounted on a boat, which exploits solar energy and ambient temperature differences to generate electricity. We posit the TPA as an essential technological tool for harvesting sustainable energy, providing a significant enhancement in electrical output and the potential to significantly contribute to global sustainable energy solutions.

## 1. Introduction

The growing concern about environmental degradation and the drive towards sustainable energy sources have resulted in exploring unconventional avenues to harness energy. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are increasingly seen as potential alternatives to traditional power sources, primarily due to their ability to convert waste heat into electricity using the Seebeck effect [1].

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Boat Design

The boat is designed with an emphasis on housing a large TPA. It is a semi-circular, catamaran-style vessel with an extensive flat deck to accommodate the maximum number of thermoelectric plates. The boat's hull is constructed with lightweight, durable materials to reduce overall weight, while ensuring it can withstand harsh marine conditions.

### 2.2 Thermoelectric Plate Array System

The TPA system comprises arrays of thermoelectric plates, each exploiting the Seebeck effect. Each TEG is essentially a sandwich of two different types of semiconductors connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel. When a temperature differential is applied across the TEG, it drives a DC current through the circuit.

The cold side of the TEG is cooled by the surrounding water, while the hot side is heated by sunlight, causing a temperature differential and generating electricity.

## 3. Results and Discussion

### 3.1 System Efficiency and Output

The total output power of the TPA is the sum of the individual outputs of each TEG. Each TEG is capable of producing around 2-3W under optimal conditions [2]. Considering that each square meter of the deck can house roughly 1000 TEGs, a boat with a deck area of 100 square meters could house approximately 100,000 TEGs. Therefore, the total electricity generated would be between 200kW and 300kW under optimal conditions.

However, the overall efficiency of the TEG system is generally around 5-8% due to the intrinsic material properties and the small temperature differences involved [3]. This indicates that while the output is significant, there's still room for improvement in the TEG technology.

### 3.2 Implications for Sustainable Energy

The proposed TPA system has a significant potential for sustainable energy generation. Firstly, it leverages the abundant and free energy from the sun. Secondly, its implementation on a mobile marine platform allows it to move to areas with higher solar intensity, maximizing its output. Moreover, it uses waste heat, which is often discarded in conventional power generation methods, leading to higher energy efficiency.

## 4. Conclusion and Future Work

This research posits a novel approach to sustainable energy generation by integrating a TPA system onto a boat. With the potential to generate between 200kW and 300kW under optimal conditions, this design proposes a new horizon in sustainable energy development. However, the relatively low efficiency of current TEG technology calls for more research and development in this field to maximize its potential.

The presented design and analysis provide a basis for further investigation into the application of thermoelectric plate arrays, with a strong potential to contribute significantly to sustainable energy solutions.
